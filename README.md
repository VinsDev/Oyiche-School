# OYICHE School

Built using Django and MySQL, the application allows multiple schools to register, manage students, classes, staff, and compile detailed reports on student performance, including scores, grades, and positions across various subjects and terms.

## Key Features

- **Multi-School Support**: Multiple schools can register and manage their own data independently within the system.
- **Student Enrollment**: Manage student information, enrollment, and historical class transitions.
- **Grading System**: Calculate scores based on continuous assessments, exams, and generate letter grades for each subject.
- **Performance Tracking**: Generate average scores, rank students by position in class, and display term summaries.
- **Staff & Class Management**: Create and manage school staff, classes, and term information.
